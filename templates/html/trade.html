							<h2>Johnson V. MacIntosh</h2>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>In 1775, Thomas Johnson purchased lands directly from teh Piankeshaw Indian tribe under a proclamation by the King of England
                                    In 1818, however, M'Intosh purchased an overlapping plot of land from Congress. Johnson's heirs sued M'Intosh for the right to the land.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Supreme Court determined that rights to convey title were
                                        based on the first rights to land
                                        (conveyance from tribes or conveyance from the crown)
                                        Critically under the Doctrine of Discovery the federal government owns
                                        the land and was allowed to redistribute it
                                        but the tribes only had occupancy rights rather than ownership rights.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        This ruling substantially reduced tribal sovereignty rights by limiting the ownership rights of tribes to their own land.
                                        It also strengthened the guardianship theory of federal responsibility to the indigenous peoples
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
