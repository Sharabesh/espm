                                The supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the Major Crimes Act of 1885
                                which gave the federal courts jurisdiction in cases of Indian-Indian crimes.
                                Thus the federal government constitutionally had
                                jurisdiction over crimes executed on tribal lands.

                                    Amended the General Allotment Act of 1906 to demand that

                                    acquiring patents to alloted land.
                                    This act also prevented many Indigenous peoples from
