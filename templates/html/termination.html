                                    This resolution called for the termination of federal trust responsibilities,essentially eliminating any view of tribal sovereignty by the US government

                                    Surplus native land was divided up and placed into private hands.
                                    As a corollary, all indigenous peoples were made American citizens.

                                    With the end of tribal sovereignty, many of indigenous origin relocated to large

                                        faced greater sovereignty infringements regarding law enforcement.

                                        The Relocation Act of 1956 attempted to encourge
                                        indigenous peoples to leave tribal lands to spur greater assimilation into the general population.
                                    </li>

                                        The Relocation Act offered to pay moving expenses and provide elements
                                        of vocational training to those of
                                        inidigenous descent who sought to move into major cities.

                                        This act further sought to forcefully integrate natives into the general population
                                        while removing their tribal affiliations

                                        Overall 109 tribes were terminated and 2.5 million acres of trust land was removed from protected status.
                                        In addition, over 12,000 Natives lost their tribal affiliation.
